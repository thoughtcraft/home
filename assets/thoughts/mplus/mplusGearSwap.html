                <h2>by Thoughtcraft</h2>

        <div class="textWrapper">
            <p>
                In the recent developer Q&#38;A (June 14th), Ion Hazzikostas clarified that the “no gear swapping” policy inside a mythic
                plus dungeon was, in fact, intended and NOT just a bug. This decision brings up a lot of underlying problems
                present in the game right now, in regards to class and dungeon balance and is not a, as Blizzard would put
                it, a black and white decision. In this post, we’ll go through some of the pros and cons on both sides of
                this conflict.
            </p>

            <h2>1 - The mechanic itself.</h2>

            <p>The first question we have to ask is fairly straightforward: “Is gear swapping a good game mechanic?”. The answer
                however, is not so straightforward. Mechanically, it can be argued that it’s not good, as it’s very user
                unfriendly, since you are basically required to either have a set of macros to quickly swap gear in between
                pulls or use an external addon, like Opie, which can make it feel like a chore. It can also break the flow
                of the dungeon as you sometimes need to wait before a pull in order for everyone to swap to the correct gear
                set. This is especially obvious during the bursting affix, where you have to wait for the stacks to drop
                in order to swap.
            </p>

            <p>It can be argued however, that these disadvantages pale in comparison to what it brings to the game. Correctly
                gear swapping for a given situation shows that the player is not only aware of the nature of the pull but
                also how they can adapt the class being played to optimally deal with that situation. Currently in Legion,
                that entails thinking on what legendary combinations, stats, tier bonuses and trinkets would be the most
                beneficial. For example:
            </p>

            <p>- Is there something I can interrupt/cc for a Sephuz proc?</p>
            <p>- Do I need some defensive gear to survive a specific mechanic?</p>
            <p>- Is there a mob that needs to die extra fast so a burst set would be ideal?</p>
            <p>- What set of trinkets would be ideal for this pack? Bursty or sustained damage?</p>

            <p>Gear swapping definitely shows knowledge on various aspects of the game, and if you were trying to lower the
                skill ceiling of the game, this would be something you would want to shut down.</p>

            <p>That being said, you have wonder what exactly you are gonna be swapping in Battle for Azeroth. Legendaries and
                tier bonuses are gone, so those are off of the table. Any arguments forward or against gear swapping that
                are based around legendaries or tier bonuses are immediately invalid, since they will not be present in BfA.
                These will supposedly be replaced by the infamous Azerite Gear, which forces us to go on a speculation realm,
                since information on this is still somehow scarce, given that the alleged most powerful bonuses (the raid
                ones) are still an unknown. The ones that we have seen however, not only don’t seem as impactful as legendaries
                or tier bonuses, but also provide both offensive and defensive abilities, which raises the question if it
                would even be worth to swap them back and forth between fights.
            </p>

            <p>Secondary stats though, are still there, but the trend we see Blizzard trying to push since the start of Legion
                is that these stats should have a much lower impact when compared to the main stat (or ilvl), which would
                make switching gear for AoE vs ST scenarios something of very little gain. This is however a big “if”, just
                like the Azerite Gear. Can Blizzard achieve such a scenario? If we look at Legion, where this was a stated
                objective, it didn’t go so well, as things like the Unstable Arcanocrystal existed and were massively skewed.
                Looking at this track record doesn’t give much hope in this regard and classes whose secondary stats have
                different importance for either AoE or ST might get shafted. Again, it is important to clarify that both
                these points are just speculation, and there is currently no way of being sure until we can get more information,
                like accurate sims for different specs.
            </p>

            <p>Which leaves trinkets. Two categories of them, to be precise: offensive and defensive. Let’s start by analysing
                the impact of the first category. Simple put: massive impact, given that they are specifically built for
                certain scenarios. For example, just try comparing Umbral Moonglaives to a Seeping Scourgewing: the first
                will be ahead on AoE packs with the latter will shine on ST. So, unless we see a massive redesign of trinkets,
                we found a category of items that the player won’t be able to swap out that definitely plays an important
                part in the overall throughput in different scenarios. A lot of players ask for a middle ground in this regard,
                with all gear being locked except for trinkets. However I believe this will not happen, simply because of
                a “decision integrity”. If you think gear swapping during m+ is overall gimmicky and a bad mechanic, it should
                not matter if you are changing half your gear or simply your trinket, which would imply there can not be
                a middle ground, in my opinion. As much as I would like to be able to change trinkets, I believe Blizzard
                has to fully commit here by either not allowing any gear to be swapped or allowing all of it to be swapped.
            </p>

            <p>This offensive trinket situation also falls in an interesting premise that Blizzard seems to be constantly trying
                to push: choice.
            </p>

            <h2>2 - The definition of choice.</h2>

            <p>Blizzard’s definition of choice seems to imply that in order for you to pick something, a sacrifice has to be
                made in another area, as is the case, for example, on talent trees where the player has to choose between
                single target and AoE talents on the same row, according to the situation they’re facing. Gear swapping in
                m+ clearly does not fall into this definition, because you can simply equip what you view as optimal for
                any pull with little to no drawback.
            </p>

            <p>Quoting Ion Hazzikostas from the Q&#38;A the type of decision Blizzard wants the player to make should be along
                the lines of: “do I want to be better at this part of the dungeon
                <span>at the expense</span> of being worse at another part of the dungeon?”.
            </p>

            <p>The offensive trinket situation is a prime example of this. If no gear swapping is allowed and the dungeon has
                fortified trash it would probably make more sense to equip the moonglaives if your goal was to increase the
                overall throughput, which would come at the expense of single target damage on single target (if you assume
                the scourgewing would perform better in that scenario compared to the moonglaives). While otherwise you would
                just have 2 sets for these 2 scenarios that you can easily swap in between pulls, now you are forced to commit
                to what you think the biggest roadblock in the dungeon will be, so there’s still some value in that decision.
                One could argue that this isn’t really a decision as you would just see fortified and go full AoE gear, but
                the same argument can be made for gear swapping, for trash packs go AoE gear and for bosses go ST. I believe
                that both sides of this coin provide interesting choices, they’re just different in nature. For the defensive
                trinkets however, we have another situation on our hands, which we will go through in the next section.
            </p>

            <h2>3 - The defensive trinket conundrum.</h2>

            <p>Playing a class with poor defensives obviously puts you at a disadvantage for pushing high m+ and it’s definitely
                a current balance problem in the current stage of the game. Some examples of this of this would be Lady Hatecoil,
                in Eye of Azshara with her Focused Lightning ability, General Xakal in Arcway, with Wicked Slam or Shade
                of Xavius with multiple abilities. These massive, unavoidable survivability checks eventually will become
                one shots to any class if the key reaches a level high enough, which is what the system is intended to do,
                as you’re meant to reach a point where you cannot progress further until you get better quality gear. It
                is almost guaranteed that if these defensive items, like Smoldering Titanguard or Felshield Emitter did not
                exist, we would not see +29 keys being completed in time and the ceiling of possible keys would just be lower,
                to say +27, for example. The problem arises when, for a given key level, class A can mitigate said “one-shot”,
                but class B cannot and this is where gear swapping comes in to play. If class B can equip a strong defensive
                trinket
                <span>for that fight</span>
                that disadvantage can be attenuated. That class will do less damage for that encounter but it won’t be so nerfed for the
                rest of the dungeon. Now with gear swapping disabled, said player feels forced to equip that defensive trinket
                <span>for the whole dungeon</span> just in order to survive that one encounter, which might be a huge time sink
                or even a hard stop if being 4-maned, turning a minor disadvantage into a massive one, since their damage
                will be nerfed for the entirety of the dungeon.
            </p>

            <p>That being said, if we look at the current situation, with gear swapping enabled, we see that,for example, for
                the top 100 Tyrannical EoA keys, we see only 2 shamans for the 300 dps spots available and 6 for the same
                ranking in Arcway. We can infer two things with this: first, even with off-meta perceived classes it is still
                possible to push fairly high keys (insert the “bring the player, not the class” dead meme here), and secondly,
                that gear swapping is only a band aid on what is at its core a class and encounter design problem, which
                makes sense, because why would you bring a class that needs to either nerf his dps by equipping defensive
                items or be babysat with externals versus one that can naturally survive it while doing maximum dps? The
                gap is definitely there and by removing this “band aid”, If Blizzard isn’t careful, classes that suffer from
                this issue will be even more undesirable making them basically dead on arrival.</p>

            <p>If we try and solve this issue however, we run into what is one of the core premises of the game itself, which
                you may or may not agree with. If you are willing to accept that not all classes play the same (i.e. have
                the same abilities) or have the same exact toolkit, then you must also accept that they will have certain
                niches that they excel at, and make no mistake, pushing high m+ is 100% a niche. If Blizzard intendeds to
                preserve this core feature of the game while providing some help to those suffering classes, the defensive
                capabilities of all classes must not be homogenized (by, for example, giving all of them 1 defensive cd and
                1 immunity, which would be a slippery slope), consequently forcing mechanics like Focused Lightning or Wicked
                Slam to either not exist or occur in a pattern where all classes can have at least 1 defensive ability up
                per cast, shifting the priority of the m+ encounter even more to just beating the timer and not to having
                the ability to survive that one shot from a certain boss.
            </p>

            <p>Looking at how Legion played out however, we can see that this problem existed and remained unresolved for its
                whole duration and that objectively superior classes in terms of survivability (looking at holy paladins
                and resto druids compared to other healers, for example) remained unchanged throughout. So Blizzard’s track
                record in regards to this issue does not seems pristine and it doesn’t give much hope going into the future.
            </p>

            <p>Another point we should touch on, is that, given the recent master/personal loot changes, trinkets like the Smoldering
                Titanguard will be even harder to obtain, given that some dps classes don’t even have it on their loot table.
                I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard straight up disabled them for classes whose role is not the intended
                one, just like the Convergence of Fates effect did not work for tanks.
            </p>

            <h2>4 - Conclusion.</h2>

            <p>In conclusion, I will be sad to see gear swapping gone, as it brings an aspect of min-max to gearing that I personally
                enjoy. Fiddling around gear sets, figuring out what would be optimal for certain pulls was honestly an enjoyable
                task, even if the process itself of swapping gear sometimes felt clunky.
            </p>

            <p>However, I can still see the value in the decisions that this new system will provide, even though I am worried
                about the impact it brings to the defensive capabilities of some classes. Removing the ability to swap to
                defensive trinkets needed for their survival only exacerbates this defensive imbalance, which will have to
                be addressed, either by class balancing or redesigning some boss abilities in dungeons, or you risk widening
                the gap between classes even more. If Azerite gear doesn’t have the same massive impact as legendaries did
                for AoE vs ST scenarios and if Blizzard manages to rebalance secondary stats, I believe the no gear swapping
                policy will not become a huge problem for mythic plus encounters.
            </p>
